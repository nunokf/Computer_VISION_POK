The objective of this challenge was to develop a system to analyze a “Poka-Yoke” proofing system. Therefore, my aim was to develop a system that could be adapted to real-time video analysis. Additionally, throughout the task, I intended to use a wide range of computer vision techniques, such as movement tracking, edge and line detection, frame differencing, and deep learning. I delivered a video analysis of the four phases of the task: the pick-up movement, the probe test, the pen scratch, and when the person places the piece in the box. The video displays the number of operations, and for each operation, the number of successful probe tests and pen marks. It also presents the current and average duration in seconds for the entire operation, as well as the success ratio, expressing the percentage of operations in which 2 probes and 2 pen marks were performed.
